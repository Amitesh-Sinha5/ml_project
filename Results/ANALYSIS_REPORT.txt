ANALYSIS REPORT - HANGMAN ML HACKATHON
================================================================================

1. KEY OBSERVATIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Training Phase:
  • Model converged after ~10,000 training episodes
  • Final training success rate: 53.0%
  • Epsilon decayed from 1.0 to 0.0100
  • Q-table grew to 72,397 unique states
  • Average reward improved from 34.55 to 52.70

EDA Insights:
  • Letter frequency analysis revealed 'e' as most common
  • Positional analysis showed bias: 'p' common at start, 'e' at end
  • Bigram 'er' most frequent 2-letter pattern
  • Word difficulty analysis identified 8685 hard words in corpus
  • Vowel-consonant ratio: 39.4% vowels across corpus

Challenges Encountered:
  • Balancing exploration vs exploitation during early training
  • Handling words with repeated letters required special attention
  • Managing large state space - combinatorial explosion of word patterns
  • Rare letter patterns (words with q, x, z) were difficult to learn
  • Long words (>13 chars) showed lower success rate

Successes:
  • Achieved 30.4% success rate on test set
  • Minimal repeated guesses: 0.000 per game
  • Outperformed frequency baseline by 85.7%
  • Perfect games (0 wrong): 10 out of 2000
  • HMM-RL hybrid synergy proved effective


2. HMM DESIGN CHOICES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Architecture:
  • Length-specific models: Trained separate HMM for each word length
  • Rationale: EDA showed significant variation in letter patterns by length
  • Created 24 independent models covering length range 1-24

Hidden States:
  • Hidden States = Letter positions in words (0, 1, 2, ..., n-1)
  • Captures positional dependency of letters
  • Each position has its own probability distribution over alphabet

Emissions:
  • Emissions = Actual letters appearing at each position
  • Trained on corpus to learn P(letter | position)
  • Applied Laplace smoothing to handle unseen letter-position pairs

Enhancements:
  • Integrated 678 bigram patterns for context
  • Integrated 8,151 trigram patterns for stronger context
  • Weighted combination: 70% position + 20% bigram + 10% trigram
  • Fallback to global frequencies for unknown word lengths


3. REINFORCEMENT LEARNING STATE & REWARD DESIGN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

State Representation:
  • State = (word_pattern, word_length, lives_left, num_guessed)
  • word_pattern: Abstract representation (e.g., '_pp_e' → '_001_')
  • Reduces state space while preserving structure
  • Final state space: 72,397 unique states

Action Space:
  • Actions = 26 letters (a-z)
  • Filtered to only include unguessed letters
  • Dynamic action space shrinks as game progresses

Reward Function:
  • +10 points per letter revealed (correct guess)
  • +100 points for winning the game
  • -5 points for wrong guess
  • -10 points for repeated guess (heavy penalty)
  • -50 points for losing the game
  • Design rationale: Heavily reward success, moderately penalize mistakes

Learning Algorithm:
  • Q-Learning with epsilon-greedy exploration
  • Learning rate (α): 0.1
  • Discount factor (γ): 0.95
  • Initial epsilon: 1.0, Final: 0.0100
  • Epsilon decay: 0.995 per episode

Hybrid Decision Making:
  • Exploitation combines three signals:
  •   • 60% Q-values (learned strategy)
  •   • 30% HMM probabilities (language model)
  •   • 10% EDA heuristics (domain knowledge)
  • Early game: Boost vowels by 50%
  • Letter frequency ranking used as tiebreaker


4. EXPLORATION VS EXPLOITATION STRATEGY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Method: Epsilon-greedy with HMM-guided exploration

Rationale:
  • Pure random exploration is inefficient for Hangman
  • HMM provides informed priors for exploration
  • Samples from HMM probability distribution instead of uniform
  • Learns faster by exploring promising actions first

Schedule:
  • Start: ε = 1.0 (100% exploration)
  • End: ε = 0.0100 (~1.0% exploration)
  • Decay: Multiplicative (0.995 per episode)
  • Reached <0.1 exploration after ~459 episodes

Effectiveness:
  • Success rate improved steadily throughout training
  • Final 1000 episodes: 52.70 avg reward
  • Exploration-exploitation balance achieved around episode 5000


5. FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

6. Transfer Learning
   Description: Pre-train on large word corpora (Wikipedia, etc.)
   Benefit: Better language understanding, generalization

7. Adaptive Difficulty Modeling
